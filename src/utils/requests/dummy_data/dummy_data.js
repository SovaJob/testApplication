      + "Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, "
      + "when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a "
      + "type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the "
      + "leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was "
      + "popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing "
      + "Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software "
      + "like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum"

    about: "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the "
      + "readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using "
      + "Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, "
      + "as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable "
      + "English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use "
      + "Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' "
      + "will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have "
      + "evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected "
      + "humour and the like)."

      + "It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making "
      + "it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney "
      + "College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, "
      + "from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in "
      + "classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes "
      + "from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' (The "
      + "Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a "
      + "treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. "
